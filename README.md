# Heart-Rate-Sentinel-Server
A simple centralized heart rate sentinel server  


This server will be built to receive GET and POST requests 
from mock patient heart rate monitors that contain patient heart rate 
information over time.  If a patient exhibits a tachycardic 
heart rate, the physician should receive an email warning them of the
situation. So if a new 
heart rate is received for a patient that is tachycardic, the email should be 
sent out at that time. The tachycardic calculation should be based on age 
(more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia); you can assume 
all patients will be one year old or older). A system for sending the e-mails
is described below.

The server will also have routes that allow physicians to register on the
server and provide their contact information.


## Server Specifications


* `POST /api/new_patient` that takes a JSON as follows:
  ```
  {
      "patient_id": 1, # usually this would be the patient MRN
      "attending_username": "Smith.J", 
      "patient_age": 50, # in years
  }
  ```
  The true patient_id and patient_age will always be integers.  But, the data
  sent to this route in the above dictionary may contain integers, numeric 
  strings, or a string with letters and numbers.  Your code must be prepared
  to parse this input and determine whether the id and age are acceptable (i.e.,
  can be turned into an integer) or rejected (if it contains any letters).  So,
  `123` or `"123"` should be accepted as patient_ids (although the string 
  `"123"` should be converted into the integer `123` for storage), while 
  `"a54"`, `"aj"`, or `"54a"` should be rejected.  
  This route is called to register a new patient with your server.  This would
  occur when a heart rate monitor is checked out and attached 
  to a particular patient.  This will allow you to initialize a patient in
  your server and be able to accept future heart rate measurements for this 
  patient.  The `"attending_username"` key contains a string that will be used 
  to identify the attending physician.  It should be in the format 
  "Lastname.FirstInitial" as shown in the example above.
   
* `POST /api/new_attending` that takes a JSON as follows:
  ```
  {
      "attending_username": "Smith.J",
      "attending_email": "dr_user_id@yourdomain.com", 
      "attending_phone": "919-867-5309"
  }
  ```
  The e-mail provided here will be used to send notifications to the physician
  that is registered for each patient.  The 
  `"attending_username"` key will contain the same ID that is used in the
  `api/new_patient` route above for the attending username.
  
* `POST /api/heart_rate` that takes a JSON as follows:
  ```
  {
      "patient_id": 1, # usually this would be the patient MRN
      "heart_rate": 100
  }
  ```
  As with the `/api/new_patient` route, the patient_id may be sent as an 
  integer or a string, and not 
  necessarily the same as was sent in the `new_patient` call.  For example, the
  id might be sent as a string such as `"1501"` in the `new_patient` call, but 
  sent as an integer such as `1501` in the `heart_rate_ call`.  The 
  heart_rate may also be sent as an integer or string containing an integer. 
  The numeric values will only be integers, no decimals.  As above, it is 
  possible that letters will be included in either the `patient_id` or 
  `heart_rate` and that data should be rejected.
  This route should store the sent heart rate
  measurement in the record for the specified patient.  The 
  [current date/time stamp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/415511/how-to-get-current-time-in-python) 
  of when the POST was received should also be stored with the heart rate
  measurement.  If the posted heart rate is tachycardic for the specified 
  patient and patient age, an e-mail should be sent to the attending physician
  whose e-mail address was registered in the `api/new_patient` route. 
  This e-mail should include the patient_id, the tachycardic heart rate, and 
  the date/time stamp of that heart rate.
  
* `GET /api/status/<patient_id>`  
  should return a dictionary in a JSON string containing the latest heart rate, 
  as an integer, for the specified patient, whether this patient is 
  currently tachycardic based on this most recently posted heart rate, and 
  the a string containing the date and time of this most recent heart rate 
  formatted as shown in the example below.  
  The return dictionary/JSON string should look like:
  ```
  {
      "heart_rate": 100,
      "status":  "tachycardic" | "not tachycardic",
      "timestamp": "2018-03-09 11:00:36"  
  }
  ```
   Note that the `status` key should contain either the string `"tachycardic"` or
   `"not tachycardic"`.  
 
* `GET /api/heart_rate/<patient_id>` should return a list of all the previous 
  heart rate measurements for that patient, as a list of integers.  Timestamps 
  are not required.

* `GET /api/heart_rate/average/<patient_id>` should return the patient's 
  average heart rate, as an integer, of all measurements you have stored for 
  this patient.
 
* `POST /api/heart_rate/interval_average` that takes a JSON as follows: 
  ```
  {
      "patient_id": 1,
      "heart_rate_average_since": "2018-03-09 11:00:36"
  }
  ```
  As above, the patient_id may be sent as an integer or a string, and not 
  necessarily in the same format as previously sent.  The
  heart_rate_average_since will be a string containing a date and time in the 
  format shown.
  This POST should return the average, as an integer, of all the heart rates that have been
  posted for the specified patient since the given date/time.  Note that
  the given time stamp could be any time, and not necessarily the time of a 
  previous heart rate.
  
* `GET /api/patients/<attending_username>` returns information on all of the 
patients of the attending physician with the given `attending_username`.  This
route should return a list where each entry of the list represents data from
a patient of this physician.  Each entry in the list should be a JSON string in
 the following format:
```
{
    "patient_id": 1,
    "last_heart_rate": 80,
    "last_time": "2018-03-09 11:00:36",
    "status":  "tachycardic" | "not tachycardic"
}
```
  Note that the `status` key should contain either the string `"tachycardic"` or
   `"not tachycardic"`  If no patients exist for a physician, an empty
   list should be returned.  If the `attending_username` does not exist in the
   database, an appropriate error should be returned.
   
The server should write to a log file when the following events occur:
* A new patient is registered.  The log entry should include the patient ID.
* A new attending physician is registered.  The log entry should include the
attending user name and e-mail.
* A heart rate is posted that is tachycardic.  The log entry should include the 
patient ID, the heart rate, and the attending physician e-mail.

All of the above routes should return an appropriate status code (depending on
the outcome, including when the request was unsuccessful for whatever reason,
for example, when the input JSON is incorrect).

All of the above routes should do input data validation, making sure that
the appropriate keys in JSON inputs exist, and that the data types are
correct.  If the input is incorrect, a non-2xx error code should be returned.  Also, 
the routes should return the appropriate status codes if a 
request asks for a patient that does not exist.  It is not appropriate for data
validation and error returns from your server be 500 "Internal Server Error" 
codes caused by exceptions
raised by your server.  You must handle exceptions and return a non-500 error code, 
rather than having the server return a 500 error because it had an unhandled 
exception.
  
Be sure to write modular code. This means your handler 
functions for routes should be calling other independent functions as 
frequently as possible. All of those other independent functions 
should be tested. As mentioned above, you should also remember to validate user 
inputs that come 
from `request.get_json()` to ensure the right fields exist in the data and 
that they are the right type. These validations should be written in 
independent, testable functions (example:  `validate_heart_rate_request(r)`).
You do not have to test the flask 
handler functions directly (the functions associated with the `@app.route` 
decorator), assuming that they have limited code and primarily call other
functions to do the work.  All of these other functions should be tested.  

(In other words, your route functions should do nothing more than receive
the input, call other functions, and return the results).

Note: for this assignment, your server will need to keep the information
it is sent.  You can choose to store this information by using an in-memory
data structure like Python lists, dictionaries, or classes.  You could also
choose to use an external database.

### E-mail Server
I have set-up a server to simulate accessing a third-party webservice for 
sending e-mails.  When your program needs to send an e-mail, it should make
a POST request to the following URL:
```
http://vcm-7631.vm.duke.edu:5007/hrss/send_email
```
**NOTE**: The port is `5007`.  This POST request should be sent a JSON with the
following dictionary contents:
```
{
 "from_email": <from_email_str>,
 "to_email": <to_email_str>,
 "subject": <subject_str>,
 "content": <content_str>
}
```
where `<from_email_str>` is a string containing the e-mail address from which
the message is being sent, `<to_email_str>` is a string containing the e-mail
address to which the message is being sent, `<subject_str>` is a string
containing the subject of the e-mail, and `<content_str>` is a string 
containing the content of the e-mail.

If the request is successful, a string will be returned indicating that the
e-mail was sent and the from and to address.  The status code will be 200.

If the request is bad (i.e., there is a problem with the dictionary being sent
or the e-mail addresses in it), a status code of 400 will be returned along
with a string describing the error.

If you have the code to call the e-mail server in its own modular function, you
do not need to have a unit test for that function.

### Special note for Mac users
:eyes: Apparently python 3.6 and higher for Mac does not come configured to use the 
standard root certificate authorities, so some folks may get a ssl error, other
error, or just not be able to reach certain web services, such as MongoDB. 

To fix this, run the following command:

```
/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command
```

If you installed Python 3.7 or 3.8, change 3.6 to 3.7 or 3.8 in the command above.

If you're getting an error like this in conda, try 
```sh
conda remove certifi
conda install certifi
```
